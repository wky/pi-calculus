Step 1

Simple type eleboration
=====

gather free-variables *DONE*

alpha-conversion *DONE*
	rename all bound-variables

generate constraints *ALMOST DONE*
	traverse syntax tree, annotate nodes with type

unification of constraints
	as demonstrated in textbooks
	report mis-uses

substitution in type environment


Step 2
Type system for Deadlock-Freedom
====

elaborate channel usage
	traverse syntax tree

annotate channel usage with obligation/capability constraints

reduction of channel usage

solve constraints
	report dead-locks
